## Introduction

This scraper is an open-source platform that runs on Jupyter Notebook. 
The main purpose of this project is to develop a program that can seamlessly go through popular Facebook groups and gather rental 
information that the user wishes to look for. Users are prompted for the start date they would like to look for and the groups they would like to search.
With this information, the program creates a final table consisting of posts that align with the user's preferences, including the link to the post, the 
text of the post, and the name of the individual posting it.  

## Libaries  

For this project I utlized the following libaries: 
getpass
selenium
keyring
pyperclip
pandas as pd 

In order for the program to work for you, please ensure that these libaries are installed within your jupiter notbook.
